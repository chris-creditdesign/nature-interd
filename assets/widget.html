	<h2>A measure of interdisciplinarity</h2>

	<p>In this chart, more interdisciplinary fields are in the top-right quadrant. From 1950-2014, a field’s position is determined by how much its papers cite outside disciplines (x-axis), and by how much outside disciplines subsequently cite its papers (y-axis). (Some years, certain fields have too few references to be plotted.)</p>

	<ul>
		<li>As a whole, interdisciplinarity declines until the mid 1970s, then rises.</li>
		<li>Over time, disciplines tend to cluster towards the diagonal. That’s partly a statistical artefact: emerging fields are small with few references from other fields, and then settle into position as they become larger and established.</li>
	</ul>
