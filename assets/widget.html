	<h2>A measure of interdisciplinarity, by discipline and year</h2>

	<p>In this chart, more interdisciplinary fields are in the top-right quadrant. [[sentence here to explain the broad trend(s) from 1950 -2000]]. A field’s position is determined by how much its papers cite outside disciplines (x-axis), and by how much outside disciplines subsequently cite the papers (y-axis). Papers from 2001–10 were assigned to disciplines and specialities on the basis of their journals, using a US National Science Foundation classification system.</p>
